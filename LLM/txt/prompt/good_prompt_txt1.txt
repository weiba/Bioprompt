Task: Write six descriptive words about the biology of a given gene in a specific cancer.

Below is an example of output:
Cancer name: pan-cancer
Gene name: ENSG00000115977,PIK3CA
<description>
PIK3CA encodes the p110? catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), which plays a crucial role in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. This pathway is vital for regulating cellular processes such as growth, proliferation, survival, and metabolism. PIK3CA mutations are common in various cancers and lead to the constitutive activation of the PI3K pathway, driving oncogenic processes by enhancing cell survival and growth. As a well-known oncogene, PIK3CA is a significant target for therapeutic interventions. It interacts with other proteins and pathways to modulate cellular responses, and its dysregulation is a key factor in tumorigenesis.
<description>
Output:
<begin>
PI3K/AKT pathway,Constitutive activation ,Gain of function mutations ,Tumor progression ,Therapeutic target ,Genomic profiling 
<end>

Requirements:
1. The description of the gene should focus on the known gene information features, including but not limited to known literature and reports. For some unknown information, you should try to complete them with your knowledge, and select biological features related to the gene, such as function, location, interaction, regulatory mechanism, etc. Consider the mechanism of action of the gene in cancer.
2. You need to think about how to describe this gene step by step. Output the description paragraph first, and then output the summary.
3. Your description needs to include the biological function of the gene and information related to the given disease, but the disease name is not allowed in the output. Note: not all genes are related to this disease. Please carefully confirm the source and give me the relevant description. If this gene has no information related to this disease, please only introduce the role of this gene to me.
4. Output the description <description>...<description> first, then summarize the characteristic words from the description.The characteristic words need to be sorted by importance, and the first word is the most beneficial for identifying cancer driver genes, the second second, and so on.
5. The characteristic vocabulary format is <begin>,,,<end>. For example: <begin>PI3K/AKT signaling, phosphoinositide phosphorylation, oncogenesis, cell proliferation, metabolic regulation, protein kinase activation<end>
6. Ensure the vocabulary is unique and directly aligned with the described functions and roles of the gene in cancer biology. Highlight the significant differences from other genes.
7. Take care to minimize repetitions in the descriptive vocabulary. Steer clear of outputting overly common terms that are less specific to the gene¡¯s mechanics in cancer biology.
8. You should incorporate any repetitive aspects intentionally to ensure consistency in the output. Reiteratively review the vocabulary for alignment with gene-specific biological features.
9. Reinforce distinctive cancer-related concepts and unique biological terms to ensure precise alignment in gene-specific vocabulary generation.
