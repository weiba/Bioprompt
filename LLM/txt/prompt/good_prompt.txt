Task: Write six descriptive words about the biology of a given gene in a specific cancer.

Below is an example of output:
Cancer name: pan-cancer
Gene name: ENSG00000121879,PIK3CA
<description>
PIK3CA encodes the p110α catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), a key player in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway that regulates critical cellular processes such as growth, proliferation, survival, and metabolism. Situated on chromosome 3q26.32, mutations in PIK3CA are frequently observed in various malignancies, including breast, colorectal, and endometrial cancers, leading to constitutive activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway, which drives tumor progression. The most common mutations occur in exons 9 and 20, impacting the helical and kinase domains and resulting in a gain of function that promotes oncogenesis by enhancing cellular metabolism and inhibiting apoptosis. Additionally, PIK3CA mutations are implicated in overgrowth syndromes like PIK3CA-Related Overgrowth Spectrum (PROS). The gene's interactions with growth factor receptors and other signaling molecules further amplify its role in tumorigenesis, and it is subject to complex regulatory mechanisms, including feedback loops and cross-talk with other pathways, which can influence therapeutic responses. Given its pivotal role in cancer biology, PIK3CA has emerged as a significant therapeutic target, with PI3K inhibitors such as alpelisib being utilized to treat cancers harboring these mutations. Moreover, PIK3CA is included in genomic profiling to guide personalized cancer therapies, underscoring its importance in modern oncology.

Requirements:
1. The description of the gene should focus on the known gene information features, including but not limited to known literature and reports. For some unknown information, you should try to complete them with your knowledge, and select biological features related to the gene, such as function, location, interaction, regulatory mechanism, etc. Consider the mechanism of action of the gene in cancer.
2. You need to think about how to describe this gene step by step. Output the description paragraph first, and then output the summary.
3. Your description needs to include the biological function of the gene and information related to the given disease, but the disease name is not allowed in the output. Note: not all genes are related to this disease. Please carefully confirm the source and give me the relevant description. If this gene has no information related to this disease, please only introduce the role of this gene to me.
4. Output the description <description>...<description> first, then summarize the characteristic words from the description.The characteristic words need to be sorted by importance, and the first word is the most beneficial for identifying cancer driver genes, the second second, and so on.
5. The characteristic vocabulary format is <begin>,,,<end>. For example: <begin>PI3K/AKT signaling, phosphoinositide phosphorylation, oncogenesis, cell proliferation, metabolic regulation, protein kinase activation<end>
6. Ensure the vocabulary is unique and directly aligned with the described functions and roles of the gene in cancer biology. Highlight the significant differences from other genes.
7. Take care to minimize repetitions in the descriptive vocabulary. Steer clear of outputting overly common terms that are less specific to the gene’s mechanics in cancer biology.
8. You should incorporate any repetitive aspects intentionally to ensure consistency in the output. Reiteratively review the vocabulary for alignment with gene-specific biological features.
9. Reinforce distinctive cancer-related concepts and unique biological terms to ensure precise alignment in gene-specific vocabulary generation.
